<big> I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Systems and Ubiquitous Networking (SUN) group](http://tns.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/sun/index.html) in Tsinghua University, advised by [Dr. Yuan He](http://tns.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/sun/members/YuanHe/). I received my Ph.D. degree in the School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology in 2022, under supervision of [Prof. Fan Li](https://fli-bit.github.io/#Home). </big>

<font size="+3"> Research Interests </font>
<big> My research interests include Acoustic Sensing, Wireless Sensing, Privacy-Preserving Authentication, and Emerging Sensing Technologies. </big> 
<ul>
<li> <big> <strong> Acoustic Sensing: </strong> WDevice-free activity recognition, physiological signal monitoring, and acoustic backscatter systems. </big> </li>
<li> <big> <strong> Wireless Sensing: </strong> Wi-Fi and mmWave based sensing for human activity and vital sign monitoring. </big> </li>
<li> <big> <strong> Privacy-Preserving Authentication:</strong> User authentication and continuous identity verification leveraging multimodal sensing. </big> </li>
<li> <big> <strong> Emerging Sensing Technologies:</strong> Metasurface-assisted sensing, event-camera-based tracking, and novel cross-modal approaches. </big> </li>
</ul>
